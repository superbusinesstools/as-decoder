## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create or update `.env` file:

```bash
# Server Configuration
PORT=20080

# Database Configuration
DB_PATH=crawler.db

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development

# AI Configuration
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-3-haiku-20240307

# Crawling Configuration
CRAWL_MAX_DEPTH=3      # How many "clicks" deep to follow links (1=homepage only, 2=homepage+linked pages, 3=deeper)
CRAWL_MAX_PAGES=20     # Maximum total pages to scrape (prevents crawling huge sites)

# Twenty CRM API Configuration
TWENTY_API_URL=https://20.afternoonltd.com
TWENTY_API_KEY=your_twenty_api_key_here
```

### AI Prompt Customization
Edit the AI analysis prompt in `src/services/ai/prompt.txt` to customize how Claude analyzes company websites. Changes take effect immediately without restarting the application.

## Running the Application

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start           # Start with pm2 (includes auto-watch)
```

### Development with Auto-Restart
```bash
# Option 1: PM2 with watch mode (recommended for production-like environment)
npm run build
npm start            # Automatically watches dist/ folder for changes

# Option 2: Direct development mode
npm run dev          # Uses ts-node for immediate TypeScript execution

# When using PM2 watch mode, rebuild to trigger restart:
npm run build        # PM2 will automatically restart when dist/ changes
```

### Deployment
```bash
# üöÄ One-command deployment (recommended)
npm run deploy

# Manual deployment steps:
git pull origin master
npm install
npm run build
npm run pm2:restart
```

**Note**: The `npm run deploy` script automatically handles all deployment steps and provides status feedback.

### PM2 Management
```bash
npm run pm2:start      # Start with ecosystem config (auto-watch enabled)
npm run pm2:start-watch # Start with explicit watch mode
npm run pm2:restart    # Restart the process
npm run pm2:reload     # Graceful reload (zero-downtime)
npm run pm2:stop       # Stop the process
npm run pm2:logs       # View logs
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test
```

### Utility Scripts
```bash
npm run reset          # Reset database
npm run seed           # Seed test data
npm run scrape         # Test scraping functionality
npm run status         # View processing status and recent requests
npm run restart        # Restart all failed jobs or specific job by ID
```

#### Testing Scraping with Different Settings
```bash
# Use environment defaults (depth=3, pages=20)
npm run scrape https://example.com

# Override depth and pages
npm run scrape https://example.com --depth 2 --max-pages 10

# Verbose output for debugging
npm run scrape https://example.com --verbose
```

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/queue
Queue a company for processing.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "company_id": "unique-company-id",

}
```

## Monitoring & Status

### CLI Status Monitor
Use the built-in status monitor to quickly check processing progress:

```bash
npm run status
```

This displays:
- üìä Recent requests (last 10) with status and processing step
- üìà Quick stats (total, completed, failed, processing)
- üí° Helpful commands for deeper investigation

### Real-time Logs
Monitor real-time processing with emoji-coded logs:

```bash
npm run pm2:logs
```

Log format:
- üîÑ Processing started
- üåê Website crawling
- ü§ñ AI processing  
- üì§ CRM sending
- ‚úÖ Completed / ‚ùå Failed

### API Monitoring
- **Individual Status**: `GET /api/queue/COMPANY_ID` - Detailed status and logs for specific company
- **Recent Overview**: `GET /api/queue/status/recent?limit=20` - List of recent processing requests
- **Failed Jobs**: `GET /api/queue/status/failed` - List of all failed jobs
- **Restart Job**: `POST /api/queue/COMPANY_ID/restart` - Restart a failed job from last successful step
- **Health Check**: `GET /health` - Server status

### Restarting Failed Jobs

**Simple restart commands:**
```bash
npm run restart                    # Restart all failed jobs automatically
npm run restart COMPANY_ID         # Restart specific job by ID
npm run status                     # Check for failed jobs with full IDs
```

**API endpoints:**
```bash
curl https://as-decoder.afternoonltd.com/api/queue/status/failed      # View failed jobs
curl -X POST https://as-decoder.afternoonltd.com/api/queue/COMPANY_ID/restart  # Restart specific job
```

The system intelligently restarts from the last successful step:
- If crawling failed ‚Üí restarts from beginning
- If AI processing failed ‚Üí restarts from AI step (keeps crawled data)
- If CRM sending failed ‚Üí restarts from CRM step (keeps all previous data)

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Check processing status
npm run status

# If failed jobs are shown, restart them all
npm run restart

# Or restart a specific job
npm run restart dr-petes-003
```

## Processing Workflow

The system processes companies through 4 resumable steps:

1. **Receive Company Data**: Company details are queued via API endpoint
2. **Website Crawling**: Extract content using Puppeteer and Scrapy (skipped if raw_data exists)
3. **AI Processing**: Analyze content with Claude AI (skipped if processed_data exists)
4. **CRM Integration**: Send structured data to CRM with sub-step tracking

### Resumable Processing
- If any step fails, the system can resume from that exact step
- No repeated work - expensive operations like crawling and AI analysis won't be re-run
- Sub-step tracking for CRM integration allows partial completion recovery

## AI Integration

### Claude AI Analysis
The system uses Claude AI to extract structured information from website content into the new enhanced format:

```json
{
  "company_data": {
    "name": "Company Name",
    "description": "Detailed company description",
    "industry": "Technology",
    "size_category": "medium",

## Twenty CRM Integration

The system fully integrates with Twenty CRM through a multi-step process:

### Implementation Status: ‚úÖ **FULLY WORKING**

1. **People Creation**: ‚úÖ Creates people/contacts and links them to companies
2. **Company Updates**: ‚úÖ Updates company fields with AI-extracted data including:
   - Basic info (name, industry, employees, founded year, headquarters)
   - Social links (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
   - Business data (overview, offerings, target market, tech stack, competitive intel, recent activity)
   - Quality signals, growth signals, industry metrics, locations
3. **Notes Addition**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporarily disabled due to Twenty API field metadata requirements
4. **Custom Fields**: ‚úÖ Handled through company updates

### Integration Flow
1. Webhook receives company data ‚Üí Queues for processing
2. Website crawling ‚Üí Extracts content using Python/Scrapy
3. AI processing ‚Üí Claude AI analyzes content (with fallback to mock data)
4. Twenty CRM updates ‚Üí All company and people data updated

### Testing
Run the complete integration test:
```bash
node test-integration.js
```

Each sub-step is tracked and can be resumed independently if failures occur.

### Adding New AI Providers
To add additional AI providers, extend the AI service in `src/services/ai/` while maintaining the same interface.

### Webhook Integration
The system is designed to receive webhook requests from CRM systems. Companies are automatically processed in the background every 5 seconds.

#### Webhook Flexibility
- **Optional source_url**: Webhooks can omit the `source_url` field - the system will automatically fetch it from the CRM record
- **CRM Fallback**: If CRM lookup fails, the system gracefully falls back to using the provided `website_url`
- **Smart URL Validation**: URLs are automatically validated and normalized for consistent processing
