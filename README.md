## Running the Application

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start           # Start with pm2 (includes auto-watch)
```

### Development with Auto-Restart
```bash
# Option 1: PM2 with watch mode (recommended for production-like environment)
npm run build
npm start            # Automatically watches dist/ folder for changes

# Option 2: Direct development mode
npm run dev          # Uses ts-node for immediate TypeScript execution

# When using PM2 watch mode, rebuild to trigger restart:
npm run build        # PM2 will automatically restart when dist/ changes
```

### Deployment
```bash
# 🚀 One-command deployment (recommended)
npm run deploy

# Manual deployment steps:
git pull origin master
npm install
npm run build
npm run pm2:restart
```

**Note**: The `npm run deploy` script automatically handles all deployment steps and provides status feedback.

### PM2 Management
```bash
npm run pm2:start      # Start with ecosystem config (auto-watch enabled)
npm run pm2:start-watch # Start with explicit watch mode
npm run pm2:restart    # Restart the process
npm run pm2:reload     # Graceful reload (zero-downtime)
npm run pm2:stop       # Stop the process
npm run pm2:logs       # View logs
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test
```

### Utility Scripts
```bash
npm run reset          # Reset database
npm run seed           # Seed test data
npm run scrape         # Test scraping functionality
npm run status         # View processing status and recent requests
npm run restart        # Restart all failed jobs or specific job by ID
```

#### Testing Scraping with Different Settings
```bash
# Use environment defaults (depth=3, pages=20)
npm run scrape https://example.com

# Override depth and pages
npm run scrape https://example.com --depth 2 --max-pages 10

# Verbose output for debugging
npm run scrape https://example.com --verbose
```

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/queue
Queue a company for processing.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "company_id": "unique-company-id",
  "website_url": "https://example.com",
  "source_url": "https://source.example.com"  // Optional - if not provided, fetches from CRM
}
```

**Fields:**
- `company_id` (required): Unique identifier for the company
- `website_url` (required): Company website URL to crawl
- `source_url` (optional): Specific URL to crawl. If not provided, the system will:
  1. Look up the company in Twenty CRM by `company_id`
  2. Use the `sourceUrl` field from CRM if available
  3. Fall back to using `website_url` if CRM lookup fails or no `sourceUrl` found

**Example with source_url:**
```json
{
  "company_id": "abc123",
  "website_url": "https://example.com",
  "source_url": "https://specific.example.com/landing"

      }
    ],
    "count": 1
  }
}
```

## Monitoring & Status

### CLI Status Monitor
Use the built-in status monitor to quickly check processing progress:

```bash
npm run status
```

This displays:
- 📊 Recent requests (last 10) with status and processing step
- 📈 Quick stats (total, completed, failed, processing)
- 💡 Helpful commands for deeper investigation

### Real-time Logs
Monitor real-time processing with emoji-coded logs:

```bash
npm run pm2:logs
```

Log format:
- 🔄 Processing started
- 🌐 Website crawling
- 🤖 AI processing  
- 📤 CRM sending
- ✅ Completed / ❌ Failed

### API Monitoring
- **Individual Status**: `GET /api/queue/COMPANY_ID` - Detailed status and logs for specific company
- **Recent Overview**: `GET /api/queue/status/recent?limit=20` - List of recent processing requests
- **Failed Jobs**: `GET /api/queue/status/failed` - List of all failed jobs
- **Restart Job**: `POST /api/queue/COMPANY_ID/restart` - Restart a failed job from last successful step
- **Health Check**: `GET /health` - Server status

### Restarting Failed Jobs

**Simple restart commands:**
```bash
npm run restart                    # Restart all failed jobs automatically
npm run restart COMPANY_ID         # Restart specific job by ID
npm run status                     # Check for failed jobs with full IDs
```

**API endpoints:**
```bash
curl https://as-decoder.afternoonltd.com/api/queue/status/failed      # View failed jobs
curl -X POST https://as-decoder.afternoonltd.com/api/queue/COMPANY_ID/restart  # Restart specific job
```

The system intelligently restarts from the last successful step:
- If crawling failed → restarts from beginning
- If AI processing failed → restarts from AI step (keeps crawled data)
- If CRM sending failed → restarts from CRM step (keeps all previous data)

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Check processing status
npm run status

# If failed jobs are shown, restart them all
npm run restart

# Or restart a specific job
npm run restart dr-petes-003
```

## Processing Workflow

The system processes companies through 4 resumable steps:

1. **Receive Company Data**: Company details are queued via API endpoint
2. **Website Crawling**: Extract content using Puppeteer and Scrapy (skipped if raw_data exists)
3. **AI Processing**: Analyze content with Claude AI (skipped if processed_data exists)
4. **CRM Integration**: Send structured data to CRM with sub-step tracking

### Resumable Processing
- If any step fails, the system can resume from that exact step
- No repeated work - expensive operations like crawling and AI analysis won't be re-run
- Sub-step tracking for CRM integration allows partial completion recovery

## AI Integration

### Claude AI Analysis
The system uses Claude AI to extract structured information from website content into the new enhanced format:

```json
{
  "company_data": {
    "name": "Company Name",
    "description": "Detailed company description",
    "industry": "Technology",
    "size_category": "medium",

## Twenty CRM Integration

The system fully integrates with Twenty CRM through a multi-step process:

### Implementation Status: ✅ **FULLY WORKING**

1. **People Creation**: ✅ Creates people/contacts and links them to companies
2. **Company Updates**: ✅ Updates company fields with AI-extracted data including:
   - Basic info (name, industry, employees, founded year, headquarters)
   - Social links (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
   - Business data (overview, offerings, target market, tech stack, competitive intel, recent activity)
   - Quality signals, growth signals, industry metrics, locations
3. **Notes Addition**: ⚠️ Temporarily disabled due to Twenty API field metadata requirements
4. **Custom Fields**: ✅ Handled through company updates

### Integration Flow
1. Webhook receives company data → Queues for processing
2. Website crawling → Extracts content using Python/Scrapy
3. AI processing → Claude AI analyzes content (with fallback to mock data)
4. Twenty CRM updates → All company and people data updated

### Testing
Run the complete integration test:
```bash
node test-integration.js
```

Each sub-step is tracked and can be resumed independently if failures occur.

```

### Adding New AI Providers
To add additional AI providers, extend the AI service in `src/services/ai/` while maintaining the same interface.

### Webhook Integration
The system is designed to receive webhook requests from CRM systems. Companies are automatically processed in the background every 5 seconds.

#### Webhook Flexibility
- **Optional source_url**: Webhooks can omit the `source_url` field - the system will automatically fetch it from the CRM record
- **CRM Fallback**: If CRM lookup fails, the system gracefully falls back to using the provided `website_url`
- **Smart URL Validation**: URLs are automatically validated and normalized for consistent processing
