Why beans? Throughout high school and college, Grace had been air frying chickpeas to use as crunchy salad toppers and on-the-go snacks. When roasted to perfection, beans have a nutty flavor and light and airy texture. It was a no brainer, given their rich protein and fiber profile, to use crunchy roasted beans as our main crunch powerhouse. The fava beans were a later addition.
